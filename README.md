Traffic congestion is a prevalent issue in urban areas worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses, environmental pollution, and reduced quality of life for residents. Congestion 
can have significant economic, social, and environmental impacts. It increases the cost of transportation, wastes fuel, and results in lost productivity due to delayed travel times. It can 
also have negative impacts on air quality, public health, and safety. There are many factors that contribute to traffic congestion, including the number of vehicles present on the road, the capacity of the road network, and the level of public transportation services.Traditional traffic control systems typically rely on fixed-time signal plans, which may not effectively adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies and delays. Moreover, with the increasing volume of vehicles on the road and the emergence of new transportation 
technologies, there is a growing need for innovative traffic management solutions capable of optimizing traffic flow in real-time.
The purpose of developing an adaptive traffic management system is to leverage advanced realtime object detection technology like YOLOv8 for efficient traffic monitoring, analysis, and control. This system aims to enhance road safety and optimize traffic flow by dynamically adjusting traffic signals and control mechanisms based on the detected presence and movement 
of vehicles. By integrating YOLOv8's capabilities, the adaptive traffic management system contributes to the development of smarter and safer urban transportation networks, supporting 
the overall goal of improving the efficiency of city traffic
